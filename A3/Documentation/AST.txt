- How an AST is generated: 
  The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is generated with the help of CUP's parser. Each identifier is 
  a leaf in the initial AST tree. Using a bottom up parsing scheme, the parser will attempt to 
  match symbols to productions specified in the cup file. For each new production encountered by the parser, 
  AST objects in the AST tree corresponding to symbols on the RHS(Right Hand Side) of the production are
  used by a constructor to create a new AST object. This newly constructed AST object acts as 
  a parent node for the children, and can be used later on (when/if they are matched to more productions) to
  construct more nodes in the tree. This process continues until a root node (i.e Program object) is constructed.
