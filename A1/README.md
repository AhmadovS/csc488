# Assignment 1

All team members contributed to the test cases in each program, meanwhile the main authors of each file are written at top of each program file.

* *empty_program.488*: Contains an empty program that does nothing.
* *hello_world.488*: This program only prints "Hello, World!".
* *A-arithmetics_logical_comparison.488*: This program contains test cases for arithmetic and logical operations with simple if statements. No functions or procedures are used here.
* *B-arrays.488*: This program covers test cases for all forms of array declarations and refereces to them.
* *C-loops.488*: This program covers test cases for different types of loops and different ways of exiting early from loops.
* *D-functions_procedures.488*: This program contains test cases for non-recursive functions and procedures that are simple in structure, with varrying number of arguments.
* *E-recursive_functions_procedures.488*: This program contains test cases for recursive functions/procedures and nested functions/procedures, and functions/procedures calling other functions/procedures.
